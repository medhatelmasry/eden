			<!-- I'm photo-shy, and opted out of using a real image of me. -->
            <p>I'm a programmer in the BCIT CST course. When I'm not doing programming for the
			course, I usually work on my side-project: a text based adventure game.</p>
			
			<p>On the left is a screen from the game (the 'map' that is). I've hand coded the engine,
			and it's a few hundred lines long so far. There's support for basic entities, inventories,
			flat X/Y maps and XML file parsing.</p>
