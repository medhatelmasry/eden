            <p>Finlay was born in Summerland, in the Okanagan, and was raised in a rural community in the Interior Kootenays. 
                Since his family got their first computer, running a DOS based operating system, he was intrigued by computers
                and their operations. It is for this reason he joined the CST program at BCIT. His area of interest is coding.</p>
