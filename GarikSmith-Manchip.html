            <p>I will now take this time to tell everyone a story.</p>
            <p>It was Valentine’s Day 2011 and my friends and I were hanging outside my buddy’s house, he was telling us about being lonely on this very 
               ceremonious day. He jokingly stated that he was going to get a bucket of ice cream and watch The Titanic. To everyone’s surprise his mom
               opened the door to the outside with Titanic in hand. "I found it" she hollered as he ran in the door eyes teary and the rest of our minds so confused.
               The lesson is ice-cream does spooky things, happy late Halloween everyone.
